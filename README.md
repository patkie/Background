Hello, my name is Patrick Kierzkowski. I am currently a sophomore at NJIT studying Information Technology with a specialization in Network and Information Security. I am passionate about cybersecurity, networking, and systems administration, and I enjoy working on hands-on labs and various projects that help me build real technical skills.

I hope to continue developing my experience in areas such as:

Network defense and monitoring,
Vulnerability management,
Risk assessment and mitigation,
Secure system administration,
Incident response,


My long-term goal is to work in the cybersecurity field as a Security Analyst, SOC Analyst, or Network Security Engineer, where I can apply both my technical knowledge and my interest in defending systems from real-world threats.
